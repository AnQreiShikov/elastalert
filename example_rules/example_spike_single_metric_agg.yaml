# (Required one of _cur or _ref, spike specific)
# The minimum number of events that will trigger an alert
# For example, if there are only 2 events between 12:00 and 2:00, and 20 between 2:00 and 4:00
# _ref is 2 and _cur is 20, and the alert WILL fire because 20 is greater than threshold_cur and (_ref * spike_height)
threshold_cur: 0.9

# (Required, spike specific)
# The spike rule matches when the current window contains spike_height times more
# events than the reference window
spike_height: 2

# (Required, spike specific)
# The direction of the spike
# 'up' matches only spikes, 'down' matches only troughs
# 'both' matches both spikes and troughs
spike_type: "up"
